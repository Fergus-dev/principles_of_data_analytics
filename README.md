# Principles of Data Analytics Class Assignment: Exploring the Iris Dataset

### Project Description

In this project, I load in the Iris dataset using the machine learning package scikitlearn. The package has a function that allows you to load in various datasets in order to practice your data analysis and machine learning skills on. The Iris dataset consists of measurements taken of different species of the Iris plant.

After loading in the Iris dataset, I use the pandas package to investigate it at a high level by checking the dataset's shape, type, and printing the first and last 5 rows. I then move on to generating some high level statistical summaries of the data, using the numpy package to calculate the mean, median, minimum and maximum values for each feature within the dataset.

Afer that I visualise the features using histograms and box plots, and draw some conclusions about the data based on these visualisations.

### How to use this project
To run this code, you will need to have python 3.[] installed, as well as the following specific packages and modules:
  - scklearn
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

This project will help you to learn basic data manipulation and analysis. Initially, I'd suggest reading through the tasks here [LINK] and attempting each one. If you get stuck, you can refer to my solutions [HERE]. For each task I have listed exactly which resources I used and found helpful. This can all be found [HERE].
