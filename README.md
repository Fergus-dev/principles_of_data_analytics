# About this project
###Learning data analysis and machine learning with the popular 'Iris' dataset
In this project, I use the 'Iris' dataset to learn some machine learning and data analytics with Python.

## Installation
To follow along and learn as I did, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:
- git
- anaconda

## Usage
Once you have the necessary software installed, open the jupyter notebook file and follow along by playing each code cell individually and in order. I explain what each code cell does, and reflect on the results in the markdown cells above each code cell. I've also included plenty of comments in the code cells to explain what each block of code does. I've included references to where I learnt how to do this in both the markdown cells and the code cells.

You will also find a full list of references below corresponding to specific sections of my code.
